# Even Fibonacci Numbers

### Problem:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution

If we get the first few even numbers from fibonacci sequence we get this;

`2, 8, 34, 144, 610`

We need to find a pattern between those numbers if we don't want to create a loop with four million size, the pattern I found is this;

`2, 2^2+2, 2^5+2, 2^7+2^4, ...`

This seems a bit hard, because using "pow" function this much in C is far heavier than using a loop with four million size, so we have to calculate our even fibonacci numbers only using basic operations, another pattern is;

`2, 8 = 2*4 + 0, 34 = 8*4 + 2, 144 = 34 * 4 + 8, 610 = 144 * 4 + 34, ... , nth term = ((n-1)th term)* 4 + (n-2)th term`

This could be usefull, so how are we going to store those values, using an array with dynamically allocated memory will cost us too much because we have to reallocate every now and then.

What do we need to store? We calculate the next value by using the two previous values, so we can use two integers to store previous values, we can update one of them using the math above, then we have to store the current sum, and we need to use a dummy to update our previous values. Thats it, four variables with a -relatively- low loop size.
